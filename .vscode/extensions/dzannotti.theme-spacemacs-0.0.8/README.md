# VSCODE Spacemacs Theme
https://github.com/dzannotti/vscode-theme-spacemacs

## Why?
I **love** the way spacemacs looks, however the intellisense in vscode is better than the emacs/spacemacs one, but why leave behind the coloring?

## What does it looks like?
![Like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzannotti/vscode-theme-spacemacs/master/images/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

## Ok I'm sold how do i try it?
You can find it on VSCode Marketplace
shift+cmd+p + install extension -> search for Spacemacs Theme

**Enjoy!**

## TODO
Add support for:
* js babel
* xml
* markdown
* yaml

## FAQ

### My font don't look like yours
I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

### Need another language support?
Since I tried to detail as much as possible, i decided not to generalize languages/tokens
Send a PR or open an issue

### I noticed some colors are off
Feel free to report the issue to investigate

If JS, try to install [vscode babel](https://github.com/dzannotti/vscode-babel) extension, if not sadly most of the times it's due to wrong tokenization by vscode itself
